-vpcs in topology represents a entirely vlan 

-firewall is the star of the show, he are the edge "router" of topology.  

-given the properly security for the LAN  

-DHCP server is on the firewall, so the vpcs can take an ip address from there. 

-vlans have to talk to each other so i made a firewall policy for them. just ping is allowed. 

-switch have no additional configuration, itÂ´s just to connect all devices.

-windows is my manager. i use the GUI Fortigate to make the config more easier.
